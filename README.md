## Get started

### Clone the repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/jorgeLanuza/Gestion-de-espacios
cd gestion-espacios
```

### Install npm packages

Install the `npm` packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```shell
npm install
npm start
```


#### npm scripts

These are the most useful commands defined in `package.json`:

* `npm start` - runs the TypeScript compiler, asset copier, and a server at the same time, all three in "watch mode".
* `npm run build` - runs the TypeScript compiler and asset copier once.
* `npm run serve` - runs `lite-server`.

On command-line start ng serve for run the app.
Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.
